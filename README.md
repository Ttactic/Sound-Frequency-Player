**Sound Frequency Player**

This Python script provides a user-friendly interface for playing sounds with custom frequencies and durations. Developed using the `customtkinter` library for the graphical user interface and `winsound` for sound generation, the script allows users to input specific frequency (in Hertz) and duration (in seconds) values. Upon clicking the "Play Sound" button, the program generates a sound with the specified parameters.

**Key Features:**
- Intuitive graphical interface.
- Customizable frequency and duration inputs.
- Quick and easy sound generation.

**How to Use:**
1. Run the script.
2. Input desired frequency and duration values.
3. Click the "Play Sound" button to hear the generated sound.

**Dependencies:**
- `Python` 3.x
- `customtkinter` 
- `winsound` 

**Note:**
Ensure the script is executed on a Windows system to utilize the `winsound` library effectively.

Feel free to explore and modify the script to suit your needs.
